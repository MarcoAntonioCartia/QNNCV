## Implementation

### Core Components

#### 1. QuantumTrainingHealthChecker
```python
from src.utils.quantum_training_health_checker import QuantumTrainingHealthChecker

# Initialize health checker
health_checker = QuantumTrainingHealthChecker()

# Run pre-training health check
config = {
    'n_modes': 2,
    'cutoff_dim': 8,
    'batch_size': 16,
    'layers': 1,
    'epochs': 5,
    'steps_per_epoch': 5,
    'latent_dim': 2,
    'output_dim': 2
}

health_result = health_checker.pre_training_health_check(config)
```

#### 2. Integration with Training Scripts
The health check system is integrated into the enhanced training script with a simple flag:

```bash
python src/examples/train_coordinate_quantum_gan_enhanced.py --health-check
```

### Health Check Results

The system provides comprehensive analysis:

```
üìã HEALTH CHECK RESULTS:
  Safe to proceed: ‚úÖ True
  Risk level: medium
  Estimated memory: 0.00GB
  Estimated time: 0.01 hours
  Confidence score: 0.81

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNINGS:
    ‚Ä¢ High number of modes increases computational complexity
    ‚Ä¢ High current memory usage: 77.9%

üí° RECOMMENDATIONS:
    ‚Ä¢ Consider n_modes <= 3 for reasonable performance
    ‚Ä¢ Close other applications before training
```

## Memory Safety Analysis

### Quantum State Memory Calculation
```python
# Memory estimation formula
state_size = cutoff_dim ** n_modes
complex_state_memory = state_size * 16  # bytes (complex128)
batch_memory = complex_state_memory * batch_size
total_quantum_memory = batch_memory * overhead_factor * layers
```

### Safety Thresholds
- **Memory Usage**: Maximum 85% of available memory
- **CPU Usage**: Maximum 90% utilization
- **GPU Memory**: Maximum 90% of GPU memory
- **Minimum Free Memory**: 2GB safety buffer

## Hardware Benchmarking

### Performance Tests
1. **Quantum Circuit Evaluation**: Measures Strawberry Fields circuit execution time
2. **Classical Operations**: Tests TensorFlow/GPU performance
3. **Memory Allocation**: Benchmarks memory allocation speed
4. **Overall Hardware Score**: Composite performance metric (0-1 scale)

### Example Benchmark Results
```
Hardware benchmarks completed: {
    'quantum_circuit_eval_ms': 608.11,
    'classical_forward_pass_ms': 2.10,
    'memory_allocation_speed': 1.58,
    'hardware_score': 1.0
}
```

## Training Time Estimation

### Prediction Algorithm
```python
# Time estimation components
quantum_time_ms = benchmark_quantum_circuit()
classical_time_ms = benchmark_classical_ops()

# Account for training steps
time_per_step_ms = quantum_time_ms * 4 + classical_time_ms * 8
total_time_ms = epochs * steps_per_epoch * time_per_step_ms
total_hours = total_time_ms / (1000 * 60 * 60)
```

### Confidence Intervals
- Based on hardware performance score
- Accounts for system variability
- Provides min/max time estimates

## Real-Time Monitoring

### Health Status Levels
- **Healthy**: All systems normal
- **Warning**: Approaching safety thresholds
- **Critical**: Immediate intervention needed
- **Emergency**: Automatic training halt

### Monitoring Metrics
```python
health_status = health_checker.monitor_training_health(epoch, step)
# Returns: status, memory_usage_percent, cpu_usage_percent, 
#          intervention_needed, recommended_actions
```

## Parameter Optimization

### Automatic Configuration Adjustment
1. **Memory Optimization**: Reduces batch size if memory requirements exceed available resources
2. **Complexity Reduction**: Lowers cutoff dimension for memory-constrained systems
3. **Hardware-Specific Tuning**: Adjusts parameters based on CPU/GPU capabilities

### Optimization Strategy
```python
# Priority order for optimization
1. Reduce batch_size: [16, 8, 4, 2, 1]
2. Reduce cutoff_dim: [8, 6, 4]
3. Maintain n_modes (affects model architecture)
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Health Check
```python
# Simple health check
health_result = health_checker.pre_training_health_check(config)
if not health_result.safe_to_proceed:
    print("Training aborted - system not safe")
    exit()
```

### Training with Health Monitoring
```python
# Start monitoring
health_checker.start_training_monitoring(epochs)

# During training loop
for epoch in range(epochs):
    health_status = health_checker.monitor_training_health(epoch, 0)
    if health_status.intervention_needed:
        print("Intervention needed:", health_status.recommended_actions)
```

### Command Line Usage
```bash
# Run with health check
python src/examples/train_coordinate_quantum_gan_enhanced.py \
    --epochs 5 \
    --batch-size 16 \
    --health-check

# The system will:
# 1. Analyze system resources
# 2. Benchmark hardware performance
# 3. Estimate training time
# 4. Optimize configuration if needed
# 5. Monitor training in real-time
```
