   - Current: cutoff=4, Proposed: cutoff=3
   - **Estimated speedup**: 2-3x (200-300ms per sample)
   - **Implementation**: Simple parameter change
   - **Risk**: May reduce quantum expressivity

2. **Optimized Spatial Decoder**:
   - Vectorize remaining operations
   - **Estimated speedup**: 1.1-1.2x (marginal but free)
   - **Implementation**: LOW difficulty

3. **Training Efficiency**:

   - GPU-optimized SF operations
   - **Estimated speedup**: 3-5x (theoretical)
   - **Implementation**: Requires SF backend optimization

2. **Circuit Architecture Optimization**:
   - Fewer quantum layers (n_layers=1 instead of 2)
   - **Estimated speedup**: 2x
   - **Risk**: May reduce quantum advantage

# 2. Reduce quantum layers  
n_layers = 1   # from 2 ‚Üí ~2x speedup

# 3. Optimize training schedule
steps_per_epoch = 5  # from 10 ‚Üí 2x training speedup
```
**Expected result**: ~150-200ms per sample (~3-4x total speedup)

### **Phase 2: Training Efficiency (Medium-term)**
```python
# 1. Asymmetric training
d_steps_per_g_step = 1  # Reduce discriminator training

# 2. Smaller batch sizes for development
batch_size = 8  # Faster iteration during development

# 3. Early stopping criteria
monitor_r_squared = True  # Stop when R¬≤ < 0.1
```
**Expected result**: 2-3x faster development iterations
