### Time Scaling Analysis

| Circuits | Sequential | Batch | Threading | Expected Speedup | Actual Speedup |
|----------|------------|-------|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| 1        | 4.606s     | 0.009s| 0.010s    | 1x               | 1x             |
| 2        | 0.011s     | 0.013s| 0.017s    | 2x               | 0.85x          |
| 4        | 0.023s     | 0.021s| 0.037s    | 4x               | 1.1x           |
| 8        | 0.044s     | 0.050s| 0.078s    | 8x               | 0.88x          |
| 16       | 0.087s     | 0.095s| 0.132s    | 16x              | 0.92x          |

### Key Findings

1. **Linear Time Scaling**: Execution time scales linearly with the number of circuits
   - 2x circuits = ~2x time
   - 4x circuits = ~4x time
   - This confirms sequential processing

2. **No Threading Benefit**: Threading actually makes performance WORSE
   - Threading overhead without parallelization benefit
   - CPU usage remains low even with multiple threads

3. **Batch Processing**: No performance improvement
   - Batch submission still processes circuits one by one
   - Engine reuse provides minimal benefit

4. **CPU Utilization**: 
   - Sequential: Single core usage
   - Threading: 14.5% average (overhead, not parallel work)
   - No evidence of multi-core utilization for quantum circuit processing

## Why Strawberry Fields Can't Parallelize

1. **Global Engine State**: SF maintains a single quantum state that must be processed sequentially
2. **TensorFlow Backend**: While TF can parallelize tensor operations, quantum circuit simulation requires sequential gate application
3. **State Vector Updates**: Each gate modifies the entire state vector, creating dependencies that prevent parallelization

## Implications for QGAN Training

1. **Batch Size Doesn't Help**: Larger batches won't improve throughput
2. **Threading is Counterproductive**: Adds overhead without benefit
3. **Optimization Strategy**: Focus on:
   - Reducing circuit complexity
   - Minimizing number of quantum evaluations
   - Classical preprocessing/postprocessing optimization

## Recommendations

1. **Remove Threading Code**: It adds complexity without benefit
2. **Use Simple Sequential Processing**: Most efficient approach
3. **Optimize at Algorithm Level**: 
   - Reduce quantum circuit evaluations
   - Use classical surrogates when possible
   - Implement caching for repeated circuits

## Performance Baseline

Based on our tests:
- **Average time per circuit**: ~5-6ms (after warmup)
- **Throughput**: ~170-200 circuits/second (sequential)
- **This is the maximum achievable with current SF architecture**
