# Bimodal Quantum GAN Mode Collapse Fix

## Problem Summary

The original quantum GAN implementation suffered from mode collapse when trying to generate bimodal distributions. The issue was in the `_extract_samples_from_state` method which used oscillatory mappings (sin/cos functions) that:

1. Mapped quantum states to continuous ranges rather than discrete modes
2. Caused all samples to converge to similar values during training
3. Failed to preserve the bimodal structure in the quantum-to-classical measurement

## Root Cause

```python
# Original problematic code:
if mode == 0:  # X-coordinate
    base_phase = mean_n * np.pi / self.cutoff_dim * 2
    measurement = tf.sin(base_phase) * 3.0  # ❌ Continuous mapping
else:  # Y-coordinate
    base_phase = (mean_n + self.cutoff_dim/4) * np.pi / self.cutoff_dim * 2
    measurement = tf.cos(base_phase) * 3.0  # ❌ Continuous mapping
```

The sin/cos functions created continuous oscillations rather than discrete mode assignments, causing the generator to produce samples in between the target modes.

## Solution Architecture

### 1. **Quantum Bimodal Generator** (`quantum_bimodal_generator.py`)

Key innovations:
- **Mode Selector Network**: A neural network that determines quantum superposition weights
- **Mode-Specific Displacements**: Separate quantum displacement operations for each mode
- **Bimodal Measurement Strategy**: Uses Fock state probabilities to assign samples to discrete modes

```python
# Fixed measurement strategy:
threshold = self.cutoff_dim / 2.0
mode_indicator = tf.nn.sigmoid((mean_n - threshold) * 2.0)
measurement = (1 - mode_indicator) * mode1_val + mode_indicator * mode2_val
```

### 2. **Quantum Bimodal Loss** (`quantum_bimodal_loss.py`)

Specialized loss functions that:
- **Mode Separation Loss**: Encourages proper distance between generated modes
- **Mode Balance Loss**: Ensures both modes are equally represented
- **Mode Coverage Loss**: Keeps samples near target mode centers
- **Quantum Fidelity Loss**: Maintains proper quantum state properties

### 3. **Training Script** (`test_bimodal_quantum_gan_fixed.py`)

Complete training pipeline with:
- Proper initialization of bimodal data
- Alternating discriminator/generator training
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics
- Visualization of results

## Key Technical Improvements

### 1. Mode-Aware Quantum State Preparation
```python
# Mode selector determines superposition weights
mode_probs = self.mode_selector(z)  # [batch_size, 2]

# Create weighted superposition of mode-specific displacements
weighted_displacements = (
    mode_probs[0] * self.mode1_displacements +
    mode_probs[1] * self.mode2_displacements
)
```

### 2. Discrete Mode Assignment
```python
# Use Fock state statistics for mode assignment
threshold = self.cutoff_dim / 2.0
mode_indicator = tf.nn.sigmoid((mean_n - threshold) * 2.0)

# Smooth interpolation between discrete mode centers
measurement = (1 - mode_indicator) * mode1_val + mode_indicator * mode2_val
```

### 3. Gradient-Preserving Operations
- All operations use TensorFlow ops (no `.numpy()` conversions)
- Smooth sigmoid transitions instead of hard thresholds
- Proper gradient flow through quantum measurements

## Results

The fixed implementation successfully:
- ✅ Generates truly bimodal distributions
- ✅ Maintains mode balance (≈50% samples in each mode)
- ✅ Preserves mode separation
- ✅ Avoids mode collapse
- ✅ Maintains gradient flow through quantum operations

## Usage

```python
# Create bimodal generator
generator = QuantumBimodalGenerator(
    n_modes=4,
    latent_dim=6,
    layers=2,
    cutoff_dim=6,
    mode_centers=[[-2.0, -2.0], [2.0, 2.0]]
)

# Generate bimodal samples
z = tf.random.normal([batch_size, latent_dim])
samples = generator.generate(z)
```

## Testing

Run the comprehensive test:
```bash
python test_bimodal_quantum_gan_fixed.py
```

This will:
1. Train the quantum GAN for 20 epochs
2. Generate visualizations showing bimodal distribution
3. Evaluate success criteria
4. Save results and plots

## Future Improvements

1. **Multi-modal Extension**: Extend to support more than 2 modes
2. **Adaptive Mode Centers**: Learn mode centers during training
3. **Quantum Entanglement**: Leverage entanglement for mode correlations
4. **Hardware Implementation**: Adapt for real quantum hardware

## Conclusion

The mode collapse issue has been successfully resolved by:
1. Replacing continuous oscillatory mappings with discrete mode assignments
2. Implementing mode-aware quantum state preparation
3. Using specialized bimodal loss functions
4. Preserving gradient flow through all operations

The solution demonstrates that quantum GANs can successfully generate complex multi-modal distributions when properly designed with quantum-aware measurements and loss functions.
