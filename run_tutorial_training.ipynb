        "\n\nTraining variational GBS distributions\n======================================\n\n*Technical details are available in the API documentation:*\n:doc:`code/api/strawberryfields.apps.train`\n\nMany quantum algorithms rely on the ability to train the parameters of quantum circuits, a\nstrategy inspired by the success of neural networks in machine learning. Training is often\nperformed by evaluating gradients of a cost function with respect to circuit parameters,\nthen employing gradient-based optimization methods. In this demonstration, we outline the\ntheoretical principles for training Gaussian Boson Sampling (GBS) circuits, first\nintroduced in Ref. [[#banchi2020training]_]. We then explain how to employ Strawberry Fields\nto perform the training by looking at basic examples in stochastic optimization and unsupervised\nlearning. Let's go! \ud83d\ude80\n\nTheory\n------\n\nAs explained in more detail in :doc:`/concepts/gbs`, for a GBS device, the probability\n$\\Pr(S)$ of observing an output $S=(s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_m)$, where $s_i$ is the\nnumber of photons detected in the $i$-th mode, is given by\n\n\\begin{align}\\Pr(S) = \\frac{1}{\\mathcal{N}} \\frac{|\\text{Haf}(A_S)|^2}{\n    s_1!\\ldots s_m!},\\end{align}\n\nwhere $\\mathcal{N}$ is a normalization constant and $A$ is an arbitrary symmetric\nmatrix with eigenvalues bounded between $-1$ and $1$. The matrix\n$A$ can also be rescaled by a constant factor, which is equivalent to fixing a total\nmean photon number in the distribution.\n\nWe want to *train* this distribution to perform a specific task. For example, we may wish to\nreproduce the statistical properties of a given dataset, or to optimize the circuit to sample\nspecific patterns with high probability. The strategy is to identify a parametrization of\nthe distribution and compute gradients that allow us to optimize the parameters using\ngradient-based techniques. We refer to these circuits as variational GBS circuits, or VGBS for short.\n\nGradient formulas can be generally challenging to calculate, but there is a particular\nstrategy known as the WAW parametrization (wow! what a great name) that leads to gradients that\nare simpler to compute. It involves transforming the symmetric matrix $A$ as\n\n\\begin{align}A \\rightarrow A_W = W A W,\\end{align}\n\nwhere $W = \\text{diag}(\\sqrt{w_1}, \\sqrt{w_2}, \\ldots, \\sqrt{w_m})$ is a diagonal weight matrix and $m$\nis the number of modes. This parametrization is useful because the hafnian of $A_W$\nfactorizes into two separate components\n\n\\begin{align}\\text{Haf}(A_W) = \\text{Haf}(A)\\text{det}(W),\\end{align}\n\na property that can be cleverly exploited to compute gradients more efficiently. More broadly,\nit is convenient to embed trainable parameters $\\theta = (\\theta_1, \\ldots, \\theta_d)$ into\nthe weights $w_k$. Several choices are possible, but here we focus on an exponential embedding\n\n\\begin{align}w_k = \\exp(-\\theta^T f^{(k)}),\\end{align}\n\nwhere each $f^{(k)}$ is a $d$-dimensional vector. The simplest case occurs by setting\n$d=m$ and choosing these vectors to satisfy $\\theta^T f^{(k)} = \\theta_k$ such that\n$w_k = \\exp(-\\theta_k)$.\n\nTraining tasks\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nIn stochastic optimization, we are given a function $h(S)$ and the goal is optimize the \nparameters to sample from a distribution $P_{\\theta}(S)$ that minimizes the \nexpectation value\n\n\\begin{align}C (\\theta) = \\sum_{S} h(S) P_{\\theta}(S).\\end{align}\nAs shown in [[#banchi2020training]_], the gradient of the cost function $C (\\theta)$ is given\nby\n\n\\begin{align}\\partial_{\\theta} C (\\theta) = \\sum_{S} h(S) P_{\\theta}(S)\n    \\sum_{k=1}^{m}  (s_k - \\langle s_{k} \\rangle) \\partial_{\\theta} \\log w_{k},\\end{align}\n\nwhere $\\langle s_k\\rangle$ denotes the average photon number in mode $k$. This gradient\nis an\nexpectation value with respect to the GBS distribution, so it can be estimated by generating\nsamples from the device. Convenient!\n\nIn a standard unsupervised learning scenario, data are assumed to be sampled from an unknown\ndistribution and a common goal is to learn that distribution. More precisely, the goal is\nto use the data to train a model that can sample from a similar distribution, thus being able to\ngenerate new data. Training can be performed by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence,\nwhich up to additive constants can be written as:\n\n\\begin{align}KL(\\theta) = -\\frac{1}{T}\\sum_S \\log[P_{\\theta}(S)].\\end{align}\n\nIn this case $S$ is an element of the data, $P(S)$ is the probability of observing that\nelement when sampling from the GBS distribution, and $T$ is the total number of elements\nin the data. For the GBS distribution in the WAW parametrization, the gradient of the KL\ndivergence can be written as\n\n\\begin{align}\\partial_\\theta KL(\\theta) = - \\sum_{k=1}^m\\frac{1}{w_k}(\\langle s_k\\rangle_{\\text{data}}-\n    \\langle s_k\\rangle_{\\text{GBS}})\\partial_\\theta w_k.\\end{align}\n\nRemarkably, this gradient can be evaluated without a quantum computer because the\nmean photon numbers $\\langle s_k\\rangle_{\\text{GBS}}$ over the GBS distribution can be\nefficiently computed classically [[#banchi2020training]_]. As we'll show later, this leads to\nvery fast training. This is true even if sampling the distribution remains classically\nintractable! \ud83e\udd2f\n\nStochastic optimization\n-----------------------\nWe're ready to start using Strawberry Fields to train GBS distributions. The main functions needed\ncan be found in the :mod:`~strawberryfields.apps.train` module, so let's start by importing it.\n"
