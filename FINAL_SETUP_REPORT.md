Training completed successfully!
```

**Key Results:**
- ✅ Data loading functional
- ✅ Neural network creation successful
- ✅ Training loop stable
- ✅ Loss calculations working
- ✅ Generated samples have correct dimensions

### Test 2: Enhanced Quantum-Inspired GAN ✅ PASSED
```
Testing Enhanced QGAN Implementation
====================================
